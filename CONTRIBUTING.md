Hi! Thanks for giving this a read!

Super exciting to see your contribution!

#### Can I implement feature X?

1. Before writing the code for your feature, please [create an issue here](https://github.com/siddharthkp/historie/issues/new?labels=feature%20request).

2. Sometimes, the feature you have in mind might already exist! or might not fit well in the tool.

3. It breaks my heart to say no to a pull request. So, please let's talk about it first on an issue!
